Installing dependencies is a crucial step in setting up your development environment for AKAI. In this document, we'll outline the steps to install project dependencies with Node Package Manager (npm), as well as how to run and build the app.

Before proceeding, make sure your computer has [Node.js](../reference/glossary.md#node) installed. See [these instructions](environment.md) to set up an environment for AKAI.

## Installing dependencies

Install the dependencies with npm:

```shell
npm i
```
The command above installs all the required packages as dependencies in your project.
