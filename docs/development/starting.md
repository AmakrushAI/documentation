## Run the App

To run the app in development mode:

```shell
npm run dev
```
Using this command will start the Next.js development server and allow you to preview changes made to the app's codebase in real-time, without having to manually recompile the code each time.


## Build the App

To build the app:

```shell
npm run build
```
The build command creates an optimized production build of your Next.js app. This command can take several minutes to complete and requires you to have all the necessary dependencies installed beforehand.
